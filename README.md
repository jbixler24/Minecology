# Minecology: Mycology meets Minecraft

This mod adds several common mushroom species and the ability to forage and cultivate them, in addition to several fantasy elements.

## Mushrooms Added
### Fly Agaric
This mushroom can be located growing in woodland biomes growing underneath spruce trees after rain. After you craft it into the Fly Agaric cap and dehydrate it in a furnace, you can make potion extracts of it to gain the *Berserker* effect, a beneficial effect for fighting.
